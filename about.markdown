Welcome to my new blog! I'm Paul van Brenk, a front-end leaning, full-stack
developer with 20 years of experience. I've had the privilege of working with
very talented developers at great companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Bloomberg.

### What to Expect

I will use this blog to document some of my personal projects and share
interesting insights I come across. Don't expect tutorials; instead, you'll find
high-level learnings and notes for myself on how to do things and why I made
certain choices.
